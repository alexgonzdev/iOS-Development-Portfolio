## Alien Raffles
[Alien Raffles](https://alienios.com/) turns your iOS device into a raffle automation machine. It allows users to mass enter raffles, helping them win all types of items. It allows for users to import proxies for avoiding ip bans, it also allows thousands of entries simmulatenously to make the user experience as fast and simple as possible.

The app was developed with SwiftUI and Combine. It also allowed for push notifications using Firebase, external repositories were used as well through Cocoapods.
I was the sole mobile developer of the app for iOS, iPad and Mac.
